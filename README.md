 The repository contains three projects:
 
 - babyNames:
 The program parses data from CSV files which contain the number of births associated with a name in the US.
 Every file contains statistics for a year. It has methods to:
     1. get the rank of a name, namely how many children were given that name in a year,
     or get the name from a given rank; 
     2. calculate the average rank for a name across several years;
     3. estimate how many births come prior to a selected name;
     4. confront multiple files and return the year in which a given name has the highest rank;
     5. given a name, find its rank in selected year, then return what name occupies the same rank 
     in a different year.

 - makeGrayBatch:
A class for applying the grayscale effect to an image. It works pixel by pixel, calculating the average value
among red, green and blue value and assigning the result to each of them to obtain the effect.
